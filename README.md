# Idea

Build a youtube player that can loop a specific part of a video.

Inspired when using this website. It does the same thing except I found the UI to be clunky (difficult to actually define the time range): https://looptube.io/

I sought out a website like this when trying to do "ear training." I had identified some notes I liked and wanted to try to recreate them on a midi controller. I wanted a way to easily play them over, and over again.
